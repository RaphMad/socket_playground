* Shutdown protocol / "early FIN"
* Windows stack sends RST when closing with incoming data (as well as on lots of other cases, e.g. sent unacked data?)
* Sometimes referred to as "half-closed"


* Block vs. non-block:
** also depends on WiFi vs. LAN

** WLAN
** block: most of the time reading chunks of 64k or 500k, only reaching about 50mbps, TCP window gets exhausted (although sometimes the window gets increased to a better value)
** nonblock:  most of the time reading chunks of 1460 - 16k, reaching 200mbps (network speed), TCP window never gets exhausted (and it seems that a window size increase kicks in a lot faster, even though its unneeded)

** LAN
** block: single big receive (2g chunk), but only when wireshark is _not_ running, sometimes also bad performance when wireshark is running
** nonblock: wireshark seems to influence the result (OS level hangup), chunks from 1460 to about 20k ("small - big" pattern)

* general - for some "magical" reason windows manages to arrive at the maximum throughput without packet drops (at least when testing in LAN)
* some congestion avoidance (packet drops, then send rate is adjusted) can be seen when sender is in LAN, receiver is in WLAN -> there surely is some "carrier sensing" going on with senders, but its still strange it is so good at guessing a dynamic WLANs speed
* reading in a nonblocking way seems to be "better" for the TCP algorithms, reaches max bandwidth regardless of wireshark/system load

* Buffers
** It seems that send buffer is not really limited, even 2GB can be put in there atomically
** Sending app can even terminate early, FINS will still be sent as expected
** Receive buffer is actually receive window - it is defined as "max bytes that can be sent unacknowledged",
but its also the acknowledge that updates the window size. So when no bytes are read by the application,
sender will receive an ACK but will still indicate window size 0 - "0 bytes can be sent unacknowledged now".

** Blocking code:
*** Packets are still dripping in at target while sending app was closed
*** Memory shows up in receiver at taskmanager (so where "are" the packets? according to wireshark the sender still has them, but memory shows up at the receiver)

** Nonblocking code:
*** Packets are still dripping in at target while sending app was closed
*** Memory shows a more "sane" value (at sender high while sending, at receiver going up while receiving)

* Wireshark / Layer 1 / Layer 2:
** Layer 1 ethernet packets have preamble (7 bytes), start frame delimiter (1 byte) and inter packet gap (12 bytes)
** Wireshark does not show those
** Layer 2 ethernet frames have the standard header stuff (14 byte), shown by wireshark + 4 byte check sequence (not shown by wireshark)
** When a network device detects a corrupt FCS, the frame is simply discarded
** Layer 3 TCP also does a checksum, re-transmits packets if checksum fails
** But in general, higher level checksums should be applied to catch errors that occur "before" data is passed to the network https://www.evanjones.ca/tcp-and-ethernet-checksums-fail.html

* Framing
** TCP provides no concept of "complete" messages, its just a data stream. So protocols/applications need to use mechanisms like "message end markers" (computationally intensive to detect them mid-message, but HTTP seems to do this with double newline) or message-length headers (WS seems to do this - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.2) to allow receivers to reconstruct messages.
** UDP is packet-oriented up to a max size, so either apply the above mechanisms within single packets, or define an application-level protocol spanning multiple packets

-- TODO

- check tcp keepalive duration
- dont sit in a blocking read, but in a read keypress -> send 1 byte after 1st keypress, then sit in another one (dont read it, check if packet gets acked - should, with window size 1 byte less)

- check PSH flag, when is it set?
- sockopts - which one exist, SO_LINGER, TCP_NODELAY, more?
- try to experiment with nagle + delayed acks - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows/win32/data-segment-tcp-winsock

- do a small udp app for comparison, esp. how it reaches max bandwidth and if there is heavy packet loss when sending too much (esp. LAN -> WLAN)

- experiment with half-open scenarios - possible via raw sockets?

- what is QUIC, look into it
- manually implement tls?

-- try to get an overview over the scenarios:

windows

blocking
non-blocking
async
wsa event based
overlapped i/o manual
overlapped i/o + completion ports

unix
blocking
non-blocking
async
