Check:

nagle with lots of small packets (different graph w/w.o nagle? may need a slower network to have an effect)


windows

blocking
non-blocking
async
wsa event based
overlapped i/o manual
overlapped i/o + completion ports

unix
blocking
non-blocking
async

tcp keepalive? (should be 2h in windows, but sometimes it is also referred to as 45s)

check PSH flag (not controllable from application, only occurs with multi-segment transmissions?

also do a small udp for comparison

check wireshark for layers with checksum, check what they actually do (do routers just discard packages with incorrect checksum?)
what even "is" layer1 w.r.t. ethernet - preemble, inter frame gap

what is QUIC, look into it
