Check:

nagle with lots of small packets (different graph w/w.o nagle? may need a slower network to have an effect)
Send and rcv. buffer sizes

do multiple attempts

windows

blocking
non-blocking
async
wsa event based
overlapped i/o manual
overlapped i/o + completion ports

unix
blocking
non-blocking
async

tcp keepalive? (should be 2h in windows, but sometimes it is also referred to as 45s)
tcp half closed? (is this even possible from winsock?, maybe with raw sockets)

check PSH flag (not controllable from application, only occurs with multi-segment transmissions?

also do a small udp for comparison

check wireshark for layers with checksum, check what they actually do (do routers just discard packages with incorrect checksum?)
what even "is" layer1 w.r.t. ethernet - preemble, inter frame gap

what is QUIC, look into it

TCP RST (when not listening?, trigger from code? - called "when closing while there is unprocessed data" -> check, also check alt f4)

great article about winsock + delayed ack + nagle: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows/win32/data-segment-tcp-winsock

receive _window_ (max bytes in flight) vs receive _buffer_ (buffered data before application reads it) - any difference, what happens when the recv buffer is full?

send buffer - test max etc.

test congestion window / slow start
