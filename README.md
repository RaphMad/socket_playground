## Introduction

This project contains some examples and experiments regarding the usage of sockets in **C** in **Windows**, using **Winsock 2**.

The project is not tailored towards any specific IDE, although I personally used **Visual Studio Code** with its **C/C++** plugin.

## Build

* The repository contains build and debug tasks suitable for VSCode, other build environments will need to set up their build chain manually.
* For VSCode, just run the default build/debug task on *client.c* or *server.c* in their respective subfolders.

## Run

* When using the VSCode build tasks, executables will be placed in **out** subfolders.
